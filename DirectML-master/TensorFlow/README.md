# TensorFlow with DirectML Samples <!-- omit in toc -->

For detailed instructions on getting started with TensorFlow with DirectML, see the [tensorflow-directml GitHub repo](https://github.com/microsoft/tensorflow-directml) and [GPU accelerated ML training](http://aka.ms/gpuinwsldocs).

## Samples

Two sample models are included in this repo to help you get started. These samples include both inference and training scripts, and you can either train the models from scratch or use the supplied pre-trained weights.

* [squeezenet - a small image classification model](./squeezenet)
* [yolov3 - real-time object detection model](./yolov3)
